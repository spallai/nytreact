This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application shows a google search on any books. You can save books you have selected and delete them once you don't want them anymore.

You can run a test and see it how it works live on: https://google-books-corrado.herokuapp.com/

To run locally install dependencies with YARN INSTALL and YARN START.
